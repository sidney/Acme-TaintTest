# NAME

Acme::TaintTest - it is all in the test

# SYNOPSIS

    The module doesn't do anything

# DESCRIPTION

Acme::TaintTest began as a way of testing a Perl bug related to taint
checking that could only be made to be triggered on certain CPAN
tester machines. The author has retained it to use for any future
experiments that require subitting a module for CPAN testing. The
module itself is not intended to do anything.
